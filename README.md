# ðŸ“Š Invent.AI Case Study â€“ Sales Analysis and Promotion Impact

## Overview

This repository contains the solution to the **Invent.AI Case Study**, which focuses on analyzing sales data to evaluate the impact of various promotions and identify potential cannibalization effects. The project leverages exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical methods, and machine learning techniques to provide actionable insights and business recommendations.

---

## Objectives

The main objectives of this case study are:
- To analyze historical sales data and detect the impact of different promotional activities.
- To identify potential cannibalization between products and categories during overlapping promotions.
- To segment products and stores to understand sales behavior patterns.
- To develop a predictive model estimating promotion-driven sales effects.
- To provide insights and recommendations that support decision-making regarding future promotional strategies.

## Methodology

The analysis followed a structured, step-by-step process:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
   Handled missing values, removed outliers, and ensured data consistency.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Investigated sales trends over time.
   - Identified top-performing products and stores.
   - Visualized promotion periods and their sales effects.

3. **Product and Store Segmentation:**  
   Clustered products and stores based on sales performance using unsupervised learning techniques.

4. **Promotion Impact Modeling:**  
   Developed a machine learning model to estimate net sales during promotional periods while accounting for potential cannibalization effects.

5. **Evaluation & Validation:**  
   Assessed the model's performance and interpreted the outcomes to derive actionable business insights.
